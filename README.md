Question 1

The function is designed to find the longest common prefix among an array of strings. If there is no common prefix among the strings, the function will return an empty string "".
The function starts by assuming the first string in the array is the common prefix.It then compares the prefix with the other strings in the array and shorten it by one character if it does not match
The function stops when the prefix is empty or all strings are already checked.
